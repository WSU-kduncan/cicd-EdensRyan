			<p> Solars</p>
			<p> The Solars are the champions of the unconquered sun and were once the single greatest force in creation. They are the posterchildren of the exalted 
			game, rulers of the first age and it is their return that spurs the setting into a period of possible change. Mechanically they are specialist characters. 
			While they can have a wide variety of interesting abilities what makes the Solars unique is their ability to choose one type of ability and ignore the 
			essence limitations of it. This allows Solar players to be insanely powerful in the direction of their focus, whatever that may be. </p>
			
			<figure>
			<img src="Images/otherlunar.jpg" alt="A fox lady being chased">  
			</figure>
			<p> Lunars</p>
			<p> The Lunar exalted are the champions of Luna, the ever-changing moon god. They were created to be the partners of the Solars and to guard 
			Gaia who Luna dearly loved. While the Lunars have been given incredible powers to change shape, they must be carefull in the wyld lest they
			become the mindless and terrible monsters known as Chimeras. Lunars one of the most popular options I’ve seen for player characters. They are 
			extremely flexible in their abilities and scope, making them excellent for “jack of all trades” characters. Perhaps what makes them most fun is
			their ability to shapeshift quickly and easily into a wide variety of creatures or even mix and match animals in a powerful beast man form. This
			lends a huge degree of unpredictability and potential humor to any game. Mechanically their abilities let them change forms to handle different
			situations and their abilities are specifically built to apply to numerous situations.  </p>
			
			<figure>
			<img src="Images/siderealsex.jpg" alt="A bunch of armed Sidereals against a white background"> 
			</figure>
			
			<p> Sidereals</p>
			<p> Sidereal exalted are the champions of the five maidens of fate and were created to be the advisors and councilors to the Solar exalted. They 
			rule creation in secret and look into the future to try to find the best and most stable paths forward. The Sidereals are the least known and 
			least played of the celestial exalted. Their powers are heavily timed to the loom of fate and while they are not necessarily over powered, they 
			easily have to potential of completely overturning a planned story with abstract applications of fate manipulation. There is not currently a book
			detailing them as a playable race in third edition but they make for interesting and powerful plot hooks for the Storyteller to use.</p>
			
			<figure>
			<img src="Images/dbex.jpg" alt="A group of Dragon Blooded, one from each element"> 
			</figure>
			<p> Dragon Blooded</p>
			<p> The Dragon Blooded are terrestrial exalted and unlike the others there is no set limit to their numbers. They wield the powers of Gaia as 
			represented by the five elemental dragons and are the current masters of creation. Each dragon blooded is attuned to a specific element, either
			fire, water, wood, earth, or air. Mechanically the Dragon Blooded have less raw magical power but greater access to magical tools. They also 
			aren’t being hunted as demons by the bulk of the world which is known to have its advantages.</p>

			<img src="Images/abyex.jpg" alt="A group of dark figures, many are wearing masks">  
			</figure>
			
			<p> Abbysals</p>
			<p> Abyssal Exalted are the result of the divine spark that makes a Solar a Solar being captured, tortured, and twisted into a new form by the
			Neverborn (the ghosts of the fallen Primordial’s) and their agents. They are the dark reflection of Solars and work to serve their dread lord 
			masters. Mechanically the Abyssals are basically Solars with a different flavor. If Solars are said to have a golden paladin/boy scout vibe then 
			Abyssals are edge lords and goths. They do not currently have a 3rd edition book but deriving rules based on the core/Solar book would not be
			difficult.</p>

			<img src="Images/exigentex.jpeg" alt="Five strange and mystical figures prepared to do battle">  
			</figure>
			
			<p> Exigents</p>
			<p> Exigent Exalted are the champions of lesser gods who have bartered, bargained, begged, or burgled the power to create an Exalted of their own. Each one 
			is unique to the god she serves and their abilities can vary dramatically as a result. The Exigent Exalted were introduced conceptually in third edition but
			do not currently have a rule book. Their wildly varying nature makes them a reasonable option for a homebrew character if none of the other 
			exalted really match a player’s concept.</p>
