			<p>Game Mechanics</p>
			
			<p> This section is meant to establish a few basic rules needed to understand the game of exalted, though by no means all of them. It is 
			unfortunately one of the most complicated RPGs on the market, but like anything else it can be broken down into simple and understandable 
			pieces. </p> 
			
			<p> The first thing to understand is the nature of table top role playing itself. Fundamentally it is a story being told together by the 
			person running the game (called the Story Teller or ST in Exalted) and the players. The ST does most of the hard work, creating using or 
			creating settings and characters and a flexible plot line for the players to exist in. She has to know the rules and the relevant strengths 
			or weaknesses of each of the imaginary people that she places in it. In return she has authority over that imaginary world and how it responds
			to the actions of the players. The players each run a single character that they have created. They choose what type of exalted it is and how 
			it fits into the overarching world that the ST has created. They create a personality and a story for their character much like any author might 
			when writing a fiction story. The element that changes this from simple group storytelling to a game are the mechanics and rules that both 
			restrict and guide the characters in the pursuit of their goals. An author simply decides how a fight will go but in a RPG you don't know. 
			You can know how good each of the swordfighters are, how fit, and any other information that might influence the fight, but until the fight 
			happens neither the ST or the players knows exactly what will happen. </p>

			<p> The element of chance is introduced to the game in the form of dice. Exalted used 10-sided dice or d10’s. When a character or NPC 
			(non-player character) want to do something important that might fail they roll a certain number of d10s and hopes to get successes. In 
			exalted a d10 roll is considered a success if it rolls a 7 or above. The ST determines how many successes they need based on how hard a 
			task is. Climbing the side of a house might only require two or three while climbing a sheer cliffside might require 5 or more. </p>
			
			<p>Exactly how many dice are rolled is determined by combining your characters attributes and abilities. Attributes describe your characters
			physical state, such as their strength or charisma. Abilities describe skills that a character can hone. For instance, I may be very dexterous
			but it doesn’t mean I know how to pick a lock. There are skills that can tie in very closely with an attribute, such as strength and athletics,
			but almost every roll will be at its core a combination of these two things. </p>

			<p> One of the major draws to Exalted though are the special abilities and powers that your character has or can gain along the way. These are
			mostly represented in-game with the term charms and can vary wildly. Each player will choose their own combinations of 15 charms when they
			build their character and pick up more as the sessions go forward. These charms will let the players do super human things, such as heal 
			disease with a touch, cut through a fortified wall, or change into a squirrel. These abilities have limitations, primarily that they require 
			essence. Essence is basically the amount of magical energy your character has available to spend. It regenerates as time goes by and the 
			amount you can hold grows as you gain experience. </p>
