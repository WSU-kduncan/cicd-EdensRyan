			<p>LORE</p>
			
			<p> In the beginning there was the ever-changing wyld. A realm of infinity possibilities and constant flux, and from within those infinite 
			possibilities rose the Primordial’s. The Primordial’s hated the wyld. Hated its inhabitants and its very nature. They fought the various peoples
			who had sprung from that chaos until weary of the endless battle they concocted a plan. Taking one of their number they shaped and changed her 
			until she formed her own reality. Thus, Gaia became creation itself. A realm of rules and order an island of permanence in the endless chaotic
			seas of the wyld. </p>	
			
			<p> The Primordial’s created the gods to run their new realm. Lesser gods to rule rivers, forests, mountains, and seas. Greater gods to rule 
			concepts like valor or drunkenness. The greatest gods who oversaw the others were the celestial gods of the Unconquered Sun, Luna, and the five 
			maidens of fate. These gods administered creation and the mortals who arose from it while the Primordial’s sequestered themselves away, becoming 
			obsessed with a strange and unknown ritual called the games of divinity. </p>		
			<p> The celestial gods eventually became jealous of the Primordial’s and their apparent leisure. They were however the creations of the
			Primordial’s and subject to their authority. They physically could not act against them, not directly. So they began their rebellion in other 
			ways. Ostensibly in an effort to help them run creation the celestial gods and 2 disenfranchised Primordial’s created the exalted. Mortal 
			creatures infused with a seed of divine power from whichever sponsor had chosen them. These champions were given absolute freedom, since if they
			could be forced into submission by the gods then the Primordial’s could simply force the gods to do so. </p>

			<p>	The Celestial gods and Gaia</p> 
			
			<p> The exalted rose and cast down the Primordial’s with the gods ascending into their places. Some of the Primordial’s were killed, their deaths
			ripping through the reality they created and forming the underworld. The rest surrendered and were banished within themselves creating the realm 
			of Malfeaus. However, as they fell the Primordial’s cursed the exalted who had ruined them. A curse that went tragically unnoticed. </p>	
			<p> A golden age began. The gods busied themselves with the games of divinity and the exalted ruled creation. The Solar exalted, the aptly named
			champions of the sun, ruled as god kings. They created wonders of technology and magic. The fate bending Sidereal exalted advised and guided them.
			The shapeshifting lunars watched over creation itself. Finally, the dragon blooded, the weaker but far more numerous children of Gaia served as
			their agents and soldiers. </p>

			<p> The first age city of Chiaroscuro </p> 
			
			<p> As time passed though the curse of the Primordial’s grew stronger. All exalted were impacted, though none as harshly as the Solar’s who had
			led the charge. How it took effect varied, but with the Solar’s it manifested as a growing madness. The decrees of the Solar’s made less and less
			sense. People were sacrificed for simple convenience or for no reason at all. The great wonders they constructed became more and more destructive.
			They were tearing down the golden age they had built, and their desecrations did not go unnoticed. </p>
			<p> The Sideral exalted saw disaster looming and they took action. In secret they organized the usurpation guiding the dragon blooded to turn 
			against the Solar’s when they were at their most vulnerable. At the same time, they conquered heaven and assumed control of the celestial
			beauacracy. The Lunars were hunted until they were driven into the fringes of creation itself. The dragon blooded rose in a new government called
			the Shogunate, and the Siderials ruled from the shadows. </p>
			<p> With the fall of the Solar exalted so too fell their wonders. Neither the dragon blooded nor the Siderials had the knowledge or power to maintain them.
			As centuries passed areas that had thrived began to fail. Lesser gods who had obeyed the Solars without question gave no allegiance to the 
			Shogunate. Plagues that the Solars could banish with a gesture ravaged the populations. It was into this disaster that the wyld, sensing
			weakness, struck back. An army of wyld folk, the fae, swept across creation. They destroyed cities, killed whole populations, and sank vast 
			swaths of creation back into the formless waste of the wyld. </p>

			<p> The armies of the fae seemed to be unstoppable. In desperation a team of Dragon Blooded was sent to try to take control of an ancient Solar
			weapon. The realm defense grid. A single member of that team survived its defenses and took control. The fae were wiped away as this single Dragon
			Blooded women unleashed world devastating weapons of mass destruction. In the end the creation was saved and the women who saved it declared 
			herself Empress. She did after all still have control of the grid. </p>

			<p> The Scarlett Empress </p> 
			
			<p> The Empress ruled for far longer than she should have been alive. She declared no heir but instead pitted her many children against each
			other. Creation continued to decay but some measure of order was imposed under the iron control of the Scarlett Empress. At least, until she 
			disappeared. </p> 
			
			<p> When the Empress disappeared chaos reigned. Factions warred against faction as order disintegrated. Strange dark exalted seemed to rise from
			nowhere to enact acts of terror. The Lunars take advantage of this breakdown to act more freely in creation. The Siderials scramble to try to 
			reclaim some scrap of order from their places behind the throne. It is into this madness that the Solars, young and clearheaded once more, are 
			reborn. Though wither they will save creation or destroy its remnants is yet to be seen. </p>
