			<p>EXALTED RPG</p>
			
			<p> 	Exalted is a table-top role-playing game developed by White Wolf and currently owned by Pardox Interactive. Like all RPGs Exalted 
				is about cooperative story telling where one player builds the setting and conflict from the background information provided and the other
				players each control a single character inside this imagined world. Exalted specifically is known for it's high fantasy setting, rich and 
				detailed lore, and the extreme levels of power and agency given to the player characters. Where as in the more traditional Dungeons and 
				Dragons a player may be a talanted monk or wise wizard, Exalted characters begin as divine superbeings and advance from there. This site
				provides a bit of the background information and rules needed to play the game, however it is by no means exhoustive.</p>
